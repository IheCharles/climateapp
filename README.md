ClimateApp is a search engine that helps environmentalists and the eco-conscious do climate research on companies and institutions, by standardising GHG emissions and other climate related data into unique public profiles. These climate profiles will be accessible through a search bar and api.
The Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed rule changes that would require registrants to include certain climate-related disclosures in their registration statements and periodic reports, including information about climate-related risks that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on their business, results of operations, or financial condition, and certain climate-related financial statement metrics in a note to their audited financial statements. The required information about climate-related risks also would include disclosure of a registrant’s greenhouse gas emissions, which have become a commonly used metric to assess a registrant’s exposure to such risk.
When this mandate takes effect I will be accessing this information through the SEC's EDGAR API making it easily accessable to the public
